For javascript optimization you need to download the latest "Closure"
http://code.google.com/closure/compiler/

Unzip the jar file and put it somewhere safe, then set an environment variable
that points to it:

export ZML_CLOSURE_JAR=/home/me/sbin/compiler.jar # or whatever

Requires the following utilities (which it calls as os:cmd calls):
 * java   # Java 6 or later for the js optimizer. I know I know.
 * curl   # For pulling all js files together, even if they're remote
 * find   # For looking at the source dir for "twin" files automatically
 * md5sum # For making sure duplicate files aren't added

Mac OSX
 * Should have "find," "java," and "curl."
 * To install md5sum -
    - Download source from http://www.microbrew.org/tools/md5sha1sum/
    - tar -xvzf it in some temporary directory
    - Go into the unzipped dir and run "./configure"
    - Run "make"
    - Run "sudo make install"
    - It will throw an error that doesn't matter- ignore it.
 * You still have to download closure/compiler as per above and set the path
